GCPD Tracker System 
===
This is a code forthe Gotham City Police Department Tracker System.  This project was assigned in the fall of 2018 as a 67-272 project at Carnegie Mellon University, Information Systems department.  More information about the project can be found at [67272.cmuis.net](https://67272.cmuis.net).

Populating the dev database
---
You can populate the development database with a decent number of fictitious records with the command `rake db:populate`.  There are over 50 investigations generated, but only one is initially closed.

There is also a large set of criminals generated this time around, including many from Batman's famous 'Rogues Gallery'. Great reading and worth formatting appropriately.


Notes on tests
---
There is 100% test coverage for existing models and helpers.  However, if there are significant changes to some of the existing models, then tests should be updated so that coverage remains at 100%.

The one exception to the above rule is the Ability model, where you have a complete set of tests, but no model so all tests will fail.  (Of course, you will rectify this situation during this phase.)


Cloning this repo
---
After cloning this repo to your laptop, switch into the project directory and remove the reference to `origin` with the following:

```
  git remote rm origin
```

This will stop you from accidentally trying to push changes to Prof. H's repo (which won't be accepted).  Now it is recommended that instead you set up a connection to your remote repository on darkknight soon and begin saving your code there early in your development.  There is no limit on the number of times you can commit code to the remote repository and remember that committing to your local repository does not automatically mean the remote repository has been updated.
